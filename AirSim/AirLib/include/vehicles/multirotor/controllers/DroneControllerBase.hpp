/// DroneControllerBase represents a generic drone that can be controlled and queried for current state.
/// All control methods return a boolean where true means the command was completed successfully, and
/// false means the command was cancelled.  
/// 
/// Cancellable actions: all commands return a CancelableBase& cancelable_action object.
/// These objects can be used to cancel the command, or find out if the command has
/// been cancelled.  Only one command can be active at a time, so the next command you
/// send will automatically and immediately cancel any previous command that is in progress.
/// Many movement actions also take a duration, and when that duration is up the drone
/// will automatically hover at whatever location it is at.
///
/// NOTE: It is very important to understand the local position coordinate system.
/// All x,y,z values below are in North/East/Down NED coordinates.  This means the
/// z values will be more negative the higher you go.  Ground is zero, and then it is
/// negative from there up.  This is the defacto standard in the drone world so it is
/// simpler to keep with that throughout the AirSim library.
/// 
/// NOTE: all the movement commands, except hover, require you first call enableApiControl(true).  If that succeeds
/// it means your application now has control over the drone and the user cannot control the drone unless they
/// flip a switch on their controller taking control back from your program.  If the user takes control back
/// and you call one of these methods, an exception will be thrown telling your program that it no longer
/// has control.  If you call enableApiControl(false) the drone will hover waiting for user RC input.
